## Introduction
Immersive Environment-Centric Artificial Intelligence (IECAI) is a prototype project for games, written in C++, which aims to make NPC AI more Immersive and Realistic. The project began in August 2020, the repo in September and the first release likely in November. It uses a simple file to interface with a game engine (implements.h), which gives IECAI the base functions to operate with the NPCs in the game engine.

## Target
IECAI is made to be integrateable to existing game engines. The AI is built with multiple factors including: Risk, Self-Preservation, Route Planning, Basic Coordination for Squads, Threat Mitigation and Full Terrain Usage. Currently, it is still heavily in development, but a basic working version should be ready around November of 2020.
