## About
ImmersivEngine is a prototype game engine written in C++, applying to OpenGL and aimed at Ubuntu-derived Linux installations. It is still heavily under construction.
#### Reason For Inception
ImmersivEngine began as IECAI - a C++ project which was aiming to improve how video game NPCs would behave. However, it became very apparent that IECAI would require a lot more functionality than provided simply by JSON files to be implemented into existsing engines.
