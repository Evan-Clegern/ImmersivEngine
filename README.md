# iecai-project
Immersive Environment-Centric Artificial Intelligence (IECAI) is a Prototype project for games, written in C++, which aims to make NPC AI more Immersive and Realistic.
The project began in August 2020, but the repo was made in September.

# Target
IECAI is made to be integrateable to existing game engines. The AI is built with multiple factors - Risk, Self-Preservation, Route Planning, Basic Coordination for Squads and Full Terrain Usage. Currently, it is still heavily in development, but a basic working version should be ready around November of 2020.
